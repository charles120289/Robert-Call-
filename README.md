final project for python class
My idea is to have the user face off against the computer where it randomly picks the options rock, paper, or scissors. The score would be stored in a file and then each game would be appended to it to update the list of scores. i want to have the file read and scores taken then scored in a high low system and print out the highest score and your score comparatively.  In the end it will print out if you win or lose, the score and the best high score from the list.

final project for python class
My idea is to have the user face off against the computer where it randomly picks the options rock, paper, or scissors. The score would be stored in a file and then each game would be appended to it to update the list of scores. i want to have the file read and scores taken then scored in a high low system and print out the highest score and your score comparatively.  In the end it will print out if you win or lose, the score and the best high score from the list.

#description
This a rock paper scissor lizard spock game i found the idea at
https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/
The player will face a computer opponent and it will randomly choose its anwser
after comparing the two anwsers the program will decide who wins each round then
let the player know the score and save it to a file called score list that will
be created in the local file system

instructions
The intructions for this game goes as follows
rock now beats scissor and lizard
paper now beats rock and spock
scissor now beats paper and lizard
lizard beats spock and paper
spock beats rock and scissor
each round is a point and it is best of 3 rounds

#Completion Statement

requirements met:
Rock/Paper/Scissor/Liazrd/Spock format: yes
use of functions and lists: yes
use of variables and storing and reusing: yes
use of code to create and append files also read and write: yes
use of if statements and user input: yes

Future work:
i would like to add some more complex and user friendly features like a second player option and also a menu that i could list other functions or variations of the program in.
i would also like to have added a way to add up and keep the highest score on file only.

depedencies/citations:
The program should create a file in your local system and should not require anything else to play.
i used the format from https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/ to create my game other then that all the code is from what i learned in our class.

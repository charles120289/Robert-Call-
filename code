#This a rock paper scissor lizard spock game i found the idea at
#https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/
#The player will face a computer opponent and it will randomly choose its anwser
#after comparing the two anwsers the program will decide who wins each round then
#let the player know the score and save it to a file called score list that will
#be created in the local file system.
